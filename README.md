# About
There are many web apps for helping improve writing, but most either cost money, or are not genre specific enough(for example, how you might write prose in a detective mystery can be different from in fantasy). So, I am trying to come up with a free web app where people can paste in their works, and it will give suggestions on how to improve. 

However, I do have dyscalculia, so this has not been easy for me. I will gladly take any help I can get. This has been horribly hard for me.

# What It Does
- Looks for long sentances
- Looks for passive voice

# What I Want To Add
- A way to toggle between writing styles. For example, if you hit "whimsical," you would get writing style suggestions to help your work read more like a fairytale. 
- Grammar suggestions
- Description improving suggestions
- Emotion amplifier suggestions
- Pointing out weak words. For example, "very" is a word that could easily be replaced with a word that is more descriptive.
